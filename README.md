## Overview
This repository hosts a Python-based computational model for simulating retinotectal projections. 
Derived from a thorough analysis of a [MATLAB implementation](https://github.com/elifesciences-publications/RTP_Co-adapt_Model), 
this project translates and refines key concepts and methods into Python to enhance flexibility and experimental utility. 
The model explores the Ephrin-A/EphA interaction, a key molecular mechanism of axon guidance. 
It is underpinned by seminal studies on fiber-fiber chemoaffinity, co-adaptive desensitization, 
and balancing of forward and reverse signaling as the driving forces of adaptive topographic mapping.

## Getting Started
### Prerequisites
Ensure you have Python 3.x installed on your system. You may also need to install additional packages:

```bash
pip install numpy matplotlib scipy
```

### Installation
Clone this repository to your local machine using:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yavuzkaraca/Retinotectal-Projection-Sim.git
```

### Configuring Simulations
You can configure the simulation by modifying the configuration dictionary found in the `config.py` file. Navigate to the configuration file using the following path:

```bash
cd Retinotectal-Projection-Sim/src/build/
```
